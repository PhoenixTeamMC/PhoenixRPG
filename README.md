##Run From Src tutorial
Here are the steps needed to run this from the source, as we don't have a compiled version yet this is absolutely necessary

1. If you don't have one already download either IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

2. Download or clone the source code from github

3. Open Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on Mac OSX

4. Navigate to the directory in which you dowloaded the source (not the src directory) using the `cd` command

5. Once you have navigated to this directory run `./gradlew.bat [idea or eclipse]` on Windows or `./gradlew [idea or eclipse` on Mac OSX

6. This should generate project files in the directory in which you have the source. Open these with your IDE

7. Once you have done that use your IDE to run the source code. The run configuration should already be setup.
